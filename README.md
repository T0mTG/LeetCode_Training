# LeetCode_Training
A place where I upload my leetcode submission (hopefully) daily to track my progress and also share my approach to these problems.
In all my files, I will try to rationalize my approach as detailed as possible so that I can have a deeper understanding of what I'm doing and it's easier for anyone passing by to comprehend :3.
Good luck, fellow coder!


(Another reason for me to create this is to not forget github syntax)
